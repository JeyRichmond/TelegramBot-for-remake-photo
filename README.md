# TelegramBot-for-update-photo
Telegram Bot Photo Editor
This C# code implements a Telegram bot that can edit photos sent by users. The bot can be interacted with using text messages or photo uploads.

//How it works
The bot listens for incoming updates from Telegram, such as new messages or uploaded photos. When a message is received, the bot checks if it contains certain keywords such as "hello" or "hi", and responds accordingly. If a photo is uploaded, the bot requests the user to send it as a file, then downloads and saves the file locally.

The bot then launches an external photo editing program to process the image, and uploads the resulting edited image back to the user.

//Dependencies
Telegram.Bot NuGet package

//How to use
Create a new Telegram bot using the BotFather and obtain the API token.
Replace the API token in the line var client = new TelegramBotClient("YOUR_API_TOKEN");.
Run the code and start chatting with the bot in Telegram.
Note: You may need to modify the file paths and program name of the external photo editor used in the code to match your system configuration.
